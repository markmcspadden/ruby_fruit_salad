A set of Ruby learning exercises using emoji

## background

I wanted to do something for Whyday 2013. My girls are only 3 and 2, so most of the "Teach your kid to code" stuff is too old for them. I thought maybe playing with images might be something they could grasp.

In addition, I've been drinking a lot of functional programming sugar water and think starting kids out on data and collection manipulation instead of object attributes and actions might be an interesting approach.

So here you have a (currently small) set of data manipulation using emoji fruit and Ruby's Array methods.


## usage

You can run this app on your machine, or try out the "hosted" version at http://ruby-fruit-salad.herokuapp.com

I believe this only works in Safari on Mac and iOS. I really want to gear it towards iOS.
